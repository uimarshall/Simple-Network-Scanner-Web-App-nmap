# Simple-Network-Scanner-Web-App-nmap
This project enables the creation of a  network scanner accessible via a web browser on the network.  The project utilizes a Cron Job every 10 minutes to trigger nmap for scanning our network and outputs the results into a text file. Then, a PHP file is used to format the text file, add a few enhancements, and present the results for a web browser.
